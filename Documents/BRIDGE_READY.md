## ⚠️ Known Limitations (ITS Token)

Since we're using the simple ITS token instead of your original:

❌ **No 5% Tax** - Transfers are free
❌ **No Anti-Snipe** - No protection during launch
❌ **No Fee Distribution** - No rewards to pools

**This is temporary!** Once you redeploy with older EVM version, you can switch to the full-featured token.

---

## 🔄 Future: Upgrade to Full-Featured Token

When you're ready to get all your features back:

1. **Recompile** your original contract with EVM version "shanghai"
2. **Redeploy** to testnet
3. **Register** as canonical token
4. **Update** frontend configs
5. **Migrate** users (optional bridge or airdrop)

## 💰 Bridge Costs

| Operation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| EVM → XRPL | ~6 XRP gas |
| XRPL → EVM | ~0.00001 XRP |
| Approval (first time) | ~0.001 XRP |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient allowance"
→ Click "Approve ITS Contract" first

### "Bridge transaction failed"
→ Check you have enough DRIPPY + 10 XRP for gas

### "Transaction taking too long"
→ Check Axelarscan: https://testnet.axelarscan.io

### "No DRIPPY balance showing"
→ Make sure you're on the correct network (Testnet 1449000)
