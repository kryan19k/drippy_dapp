# 🚀 Quick Fix: Admin Access

## ✅ Done - Network Updated!

Your app is now configured for **XRPL EVM Testnet (Chain 1449000)**!

---

## 🔧 3-Step Fix

### **Step 1: Update MetaMask** 

Add the correct testnet to MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click "Add Network" 
3. Enter these details:

```
Network Name: XRPL EVM Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.testnet.xrplevm.org
Chain ID: 1449000
Currency Symbol: XRP
Block Explorer: https://evm-sidechain.xrpl.org
```

4. Save and switch to this network

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Test Admin Access**

1. Open app in browser
2. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
3. Open console (F12) to see debug logs
4. Connect wallet with address: `0x817c2Fed47Fb4f5a86bfCe9d8A10A59e7E981B40`
5. Navigate to `/admin`

## 🔍 What to Look For in Console

When you connect, you should see:

```javascript
🔗 Current EVM Chain ID: 1449000
Expected: 1440000 (Mainnet) or 1449000 (Testnet)

👤 Checking admin roles for: 0x817c2Fed47Fb4f5a86bfCe9d8A10A59e7E981B40
🔐 DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE check: true  // ← Should be TRUE!
```

If `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE check: true` → **Admin page will work!** ✅

If `false` → Something is wrong with the contract deployment

## 🐛 If Still "Access Denied"

**Check 1: Correct Network?**
```bash
# In MetaMask, verify:
- Network: "XRPL EVM Testnet"
- Chain ID: 1449000
- RPC: https://rpc.testnet.xrplevm.org
```

**Check 2: Correct Address?**
```bash
# In MetaMask, verify address is:
0x817c2Fed47Fb4f5a86bfCe9d8A10A59e7E981B40
```

**Check 3: Console Logs?**
```bash
# Open browser console (F12)
# Look for: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE check: true
# If false, contract may not be deployed by this address
```

**Check 4: Dev Server Restarted?**
```bash
# Make sure you restarted after config changes!
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Network Auto-Detection

The app will automatically:
- Detect if you're on the wrong network
- Prompt you to switch to Chain 1449000
- Add the network to MetaMask if not found

Just click "Switch" or "Approve" when MetaMask asks!
