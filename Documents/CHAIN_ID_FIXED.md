# ✅ Chain ID Issue RESOLVED!

## 🔍 The Problem

MetaMask was showing error:
> "Chain ID returned by the custom network does not match the submitted chain ID"

**We were using:** Chain ID `1440002`  
**RPC was returning:** Chain ID `1440000` (hex: `0x15f900`)

---

## ✅ The Fix

### 1. Verified Actual Chain ID from RPC

Ran this command to check what the RPC actually returns:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}' \
  https://rpc.xrplevm.org
```

**Response:** `"0x15f900"` = **1440000** in decimal

### 2. Updated All Config Files

**Changed from:** `1440002` → **`1440000`**

#### Files Updated:
- ✅ `frontend/src/config/appkit.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/src/types/network.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/src/contexts/EVMContext.tsx`

---

## 📊 Correct Network Details

### XRPL EVM Mainnet
- **Chain ID:** `1440000` ✅ (hex: `0x15f900`)
- **RPC URL:** `https://rpc.xrplevm.org`
- **Explorer:** `https://explorer.xrplevm.org`
- **Currency:** XRP
- **Decimals:** 18

### XRPL EVM Testnet
⚠️ **Note:** The testnet RPC `rpc-evm-sidechain.xrpl.org` doesn't exist.

For now, testnet is configured with:
- **Chain ID:** `1440002` (placeholder)
- **RPC URL:** `https://rpc.xrplevm.org` (using mainnet as fallback)

**TODO:** Find the correct testnet RPC endpoint and chain ID.

## 🧪 Testing

After restarting the dev server:

### ✅ Should Work Now:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Select "EVM Mainnet"
3. Click "Connect Wallet"
4. Choose MetaMask
5. MetaMask should add network with chain ID **1440000**
6. ✅ Connection should succeed!

### Before Adding Network:
If you added the network before, **DELETE IT FIRST:**
1. Open MetaMask → Settings → Networks
2. Delete "XRPL EVM Sidechain"
3. Try connecting again through the app

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Mainnet Chain ID is 1440000, NOT 1440002!**
2. **Testnet RPC endpoint needs to be found**
3. **Always restart dev server after config changes**

---

## 🔄 Restart Required

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Chain ID Conversion Reference

| Decimal | Hexadecimal | Network |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1440000 | 0x15f900 | XRPL EVM Mainnet ✅ |
| 1440001 | 0x15f901 | Unknown |
| 1440002 | 0x15f902 | XRPL EVM Testnet (?) |

---

## ✅ Status: FIXED!

The chain ID mismatch is now resolved. MetaMask should connect successfully to XRPL EVM Mainnet with chain ID **1440000**.
