# üéØ Canonical Token - Immediate Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What We Just Built

I've created a complete implementation to bridge your ORIGINAL DRIPPY token while **preserving ALL features**:

### Files Created:
1. **`register-canonical-token.js`** - Registers your token with Axelar ITS
2. **`deploy-remote-canonical.js`** - Deploys wrapped version on XRPL
3. **`CANONICAL_TOKEN_GUIDE.md`** - Complete implementation guide

### What This Means:
- ‚úÖ Your 5% tax system - **PRESERVED**
- ‚úÖ Anti-snipe protection - **PRESERVED**
- ‚úÖ Fee distribution to 4 pools - **PRESERVED**
- ‚úÖ All your custom logic - **INTACT**

## üöß Current Blocker: ITS Factory Address

Before we can run the scripts, we need **ONE piece of information**:

### The `InterchainTokenFactory` Address for XRPL EVM Testnet

This is Axelar's factory contract that will register your token.

---

## üîç How to Find It (3 Options)

### Option 1: Check Axelar Official Docs (Fastest)

1. Go to: https://docs.axelar.dev/resources/contract-addresses/testnet
2. Look for **"XRPL EVM"** or **"XRPL Sidechain"** section
3. Find **"InterchainTokenFactory"** address
4. It should look like: `0x...` (42 characters)

### Option 2: Ask Axelar Discord (Most Reliable)

1. Join: https://discord.gg/axelar
2. Go to `#developers` channel
3. Ask:
```
Hi! I'm trying to register a canonical token on XRPL EVM Testnet (Chain ID 1449000).
What's the InterchainTokenFactory address for this network?

My token: 0xAb09F142b1550253bAd5F8D4E28592Da0716c62A
```

4. They usually respond within minutes!

### Option 3: Check Axelar GitHub (Most Technical)

1. Go to: https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments
2. Look in `/testnet` folder
3. Find XRPL EVM deployments
4. Look for `InterchainTokenFactory` address

---

## üìù Once You Have the Address

### 1. Update `register-canonical-token.js`

Line 30, replace:
```javascript
ITS_FACTORY_ADDRESS: '0x...', // Replace this
```

With:
```javascript
ITS_FACTORY_ADDRESS: '0xYOUR_ACTUAL_ADDRESS', // ‚Üê Paste here
```

### 2. Update `deploy-remote-canonical.js`

Line 21, same change:
```javascript
ITS_FACTORY_ADDRESS: '0xYOUR_ACTUAL_ADDRESS', // ‚Üê Paste here
```

### 3. Run Registration

```bash
node register-canonical-token.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Registration confirmed!
üéâ Token ID: 0x123abc...
```

**SAVE THAT TOKEN ID!**

### 4. Deploy to XRPL

```bash
node deploy-remote-canonical.js
```

Wait 2-5 minutes for cross-chain deployment.

### 5. Update Frontend

Add to `frontend/.env`:
```bash
VITE_CANONICAL_DRIPPY_TOKEN_ID=0x... # From step 3
VITE_DRIPPY_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xAb09F142b1550253bAd5F8D4E28592Da0716c62A
```

### 6. Test!

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Go to `/bridge` and try with 100 DRIPPY first!

---

## üéØ Alternative: Use Portal (No Code)

If you can't find the address or prefer a UI:

1. Go to: https://testnet.interchain.axelar.dev/
2. Connect your deployer wallet
3. Click "Register Existing Token"
4. Enter your DRIPPY address: `0xAb09F142b1550253bAd5F8D4E28592Da0716c62A`
5. Follow the UI prompts
6. Deploy to XRPL Mainnet from there

This does the SAME thing as our scripts but through a web interface.

---

## ‚è∞ Timeline

Once you have the ITS Factory address:

- **Register**: 2 minutes
- **Deploy Remote**: 5 minutes
- **Update Frontend**: 2 minutes
- **Test**: 5 minutes

**Total: ~15 minutes from address to working bridge!**

## üí° Why This Is Better Than the Simple ITS Token

Remember, you already created a simple ITS token at `0x3c9DD78A661c5CF6890b6fB05e85d09006360d2A`.

### Simple ITS Token Pros:
- ‚úÖ Works immediately (no setup)
- ‚úÖ Bridging built-in

### Simple ITS Token Cons:
- ‚ùå **NO TAX** - Lost your 5% revenue!
- ‚ùå **NO ANTI-SNIPE** - Bots can attack!
- ‚ùå **NO FEE DISTRIBUTION** - No rewards for holders!
- ‚ùå **Basic ERC-20** - All your features gone!

### Canonical Token (What You're Building Now) Pros:
- ‚úÖ **KEEPS ALL YOUR FEATURES!**
- ‚úÖ Tax system intact
- ‚úÖ Anti-snipe working
- ‚úÖ Fee distribution to all pools
- ‚úÖ All your hard work preserved

### Canonical Token Cons:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need ITS Factory address (2 min to find)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Registration step required (2 min)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deploy remote step required (5 min)

**Worth it?** Absolutely! You're preserving months of development work! üéâ

## üöÄ What to Do Right Now

1. **Find ITS Factory Address** (choose one of 3 methods above)
2. **Update both scripts** with the address
3. **Run registration** (`node register-canonical-token.js`)
4. **Message me** with the tokenId you get!

I'll help you with the rest! ü§ù

## üìû Need Help?

I'm here to help! Just tell me:
- ‚úÖ If you found the ITS Factory address
- ‚úÖ If you prefer using the Portal instead
- ‚úÖ If you want to use the simple ITS token for now and upgrade later

Let's get this bridge launched! üåâ

**P.S.**: If XRPL EVM isn't officially supported by Axelar ITS yet, we have a backup plan: deploy your own Token Manager contract. But let's try the official way first! üî•
